# Hand Detection Model  

## Overview  
A real-time hand detection system that uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect and track hands in video streams. This project leverages OpenCV for image processing, MediaPipe for hand landmark extraction, and Scikit-learn for classification. Performance metrics and insights are visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn.  

## Features  
- **Real-Time Detection:** Efficiently detects and tracks hands in live video streams or images.  
- **Hand Landmark Detection:** Uses MediaPipe to extract 21 key landmark points on each hand.  

### Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV - Image processing and video stream handling
- MediaPipe - Hand landmark extraction
- Scikit-learn - Machine learning classification
- Matplotlib & Seaborn - Data visualization
